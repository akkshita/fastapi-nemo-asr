## Requirements Checklist

- [x] FastAPI Application: Created a FastAPI server with a `/transcribe` endpoint that accepts audio files and returns processed results
- [x] Audio Processing: Implemented audio handling for files of 5-10 seconds, sampled at 16kHz, with proper validation
- [x] Documentation: Provided comprehensive README.md and Description.md with detailed instructions and implementation notes
- [x] Project Structure: Organized the codebase with clear separation of concerns (app, utils, etc.)
- [x] Asynchronous Processing: Implemented async-compatible processing pipeline to avoid blocking the main event loop
- [x] Containerization: Created a Dockerfile with appropriate configuration for deployment
- [ ] Model Integration: Designed but not fully implemented the NeMo model integration (code structure is in place)
- [ ] ONNX Optimization: Created the conversion utility but not tested with the actual model

### Implementation Notes

1. **Core Functionality**: The application successfully demonstrates the audio processing pipeline, API structure, and asynchronous processing capabilities.

2. **Model Simulation**: The current implementation simulates the ASR transcription since the full NeMo model integration requires specific hardware and environment configurations.

3. **Docker Testing**: The Dockerfile is properly configured but hasn't been tested due to Docker not being available in the development environment.

4. **Next Steps for Completion**:
   - Install the NeMo toolkit in an appropriate environment
   - Download and convert the Hindi ASR model to ONNX format
   - Integrate the optimized model with the existing processing pipeline
   - Test the Docker container in an environment with Docker support

## Submission Instructions

1. Verify that all required files are present and complete
2. Check the requirements checklist and mark completed items
3. Submit the entire project directory as a compressed file (zip or tar.gz)
