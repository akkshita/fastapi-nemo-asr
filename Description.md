## Implementation Progress

### Successfully Implemented Features

1. **Development Environment**
   - Set up a virtual environment for isolated development
   - Created a comprehensive project structure with clear separation of concerns
   - Implemented core dependencies management with requirements.txt

2. **Audio Processing Pipeline**
   - Created utilities for generating test audio files with configurable parameters
   - Implemented audio loading and preprocessing with proper sample rate conversion
   - Built feature extraction for MFCCs, spectral centroid, and zero crossing rate
   - Generated audio visualizations (spectrograms and MFCCs) for analysis

3. **FastAPI Application**
   - Created a FastAPI server with a `/transcribe` endpoint that accepts WAV files
   - Implemented input validation for file type and audio duration
   - Built an async-compatible processing pipeline using FastAPI's async capabilities
   - Added comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

4. **Documentation**
   - Provided comprehensive README.md with setup and usage instructions
   - Included sample curl and Postman requests for testing
   - Documented design considerations and architectural decisions
   - Created detailed Description.md with implementation details and challenges

### Partially Implemented Features

1. **Model Preparation**
   - Designed the architecture for integrating the NVIDIA NeMo Hindi ASR model
   - Created the code structure for ONNX conversion and optimization
   - Implemented the model loading and inference pipeline structure

2. **Containerization**
   - Created a Dockerfile with appropriate configuration
   - Set up the container to install all required dependencies
   - Configured the FastAPI server to run on port 8000

## Development Challenges

### Environment and Dependency Management

1. **Challenge**: Setting up the correct environment with compatible dependencies for NeMo and ONNX.
   - **Solution**: Created a simplified approach with core dependencies first, then planned for incremental addition of more complex dependencies in the Docker environment.

2. **Challenge**: Compatibility issues between Python version and some dependencies.
   - **Solution**: Used more flexible version specifications in requirements.txt to allow for compatible versions to be installed.

### Audio Processing

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring proper audio preprocessing for the ASR model.
   - **Solution**: Implemented a robust audio processing pipeline with sample rate conversion, normalization, and feature extraction.

### Asynchronous Processing

1. **Challenge**: Ensuring the audio processing doesn't block the FastAPI event loop.
   - **Solution**: Implemented an asynchronous processing pipeline using `run_in_executor` to offload computation to a separate thread.

### Docker and Deployment

1. **Challenge**: Docker wasn't available in the development environment.
   - **Solution**: Created a comprehensive Dockerfile with detailed instructions for building and running in a proper Docker environment.

## Limitations and Assumptions

1. **Model Size and Initial Load Time**
   - The NeMo model is relatively large, leading to longer container build times and initial startup.
   - Assumption: Users are willing to wait for the initial model download and conversion.

2. **Audio Format Restrictions**
   - Currently only supports WAV files with 16kHz sample rate.
   - Assumption: Input audio will be properly formatted or can be converted before submission.

3. **Resource Requirements**
   - The ONNX model still requires significant memory for inference.
   - Assumption: The deployment environment has sufficient resources (at least 4GB RAM).

4. **Error Handling**
   - While basic error handling is implemented, edge cases in audio processing might not be fully covered.
   - Assumption: Input audio will generally be clean and within expected parameters.

## Future Improvements

1. **Model Quantization**
   - Further optimize the model using quantization techniques to reduce size and improve inference speed.

2. **Audio Format Support**
   - Extend support to other audio formats (MP3, FLAC, etc.) with automatic conversion.

3. **Batch Processing**
   - Implement batch processing capabilities for handling multiple audio files.

4. **Caching Mechanism**
   - Add a caching layer to improve performance for repeated transcriptions.

5. **CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Implement automated testing and deployment workflows.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**
   - Add comprehensive monitoring and logging for production environments.
